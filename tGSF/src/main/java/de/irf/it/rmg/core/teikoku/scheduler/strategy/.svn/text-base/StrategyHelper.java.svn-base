	 * {@link #determineRequestedStartTime(OldJob)}, which has to be

	 * 
	 * In the former case, the behaviour of this method directly corresponds to
	 * the <em>First-Come-First-Serve</em> (FCFS) scheduling algorithm: if the
	 * search is successful, a possible slot is returned with the determined
	 * start time and (estimated) end time and the set of resources that could
	 * be occupied by the job. Otherwise, nothing is returned.
	 * 
	 * In the latter case, the behaviour of this method is characterized by an
	 * <em>As-Soon-As-Possible</em> (ASAP) policy: searching will
	 * <strong>always</strong> yield a result; however, such a slot is not
	 * anymore guaranteed to start now, but may be delayed until the end of the
