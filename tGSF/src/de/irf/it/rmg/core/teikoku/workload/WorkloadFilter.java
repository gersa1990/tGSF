	 * job <em>or</em> the filter could "fix" the job, it returns
	 * <code>true</code>.
	 * 
	 * The process of "fixing" allows the filter to manipulate in such a way
	 * that it's specification would let the manipulated job pass, although the
	 * original job would have been filtered out. This allows imposing certain
	 * "check-and-repair" functionality within the filter.
	 * 
	 * The implementation (on the filter side) and usage (on the client side) of
	 * fixing functionality is optional.

	 *            specification. If fixing is allowed, the given {@link Job}
	 *            object may be manipulated by the filter.
	 * @param fix
	 *            Denotes whether, for this filter applicance, fixing is
	 *            allowed. If <code>true</code>, the filter <strong>may</strong>
	 *            try to fix jobs that would have been filtered out normally and
	 *            let them pass through. Otherwise, jobs matching the filter's
	 *            specification are always filtered out.
	 * @return <code>true</code>, if the job passed this filter;
